# My Hobby Page

## Planning

I planned my website wireframe using [Whimsicle] (https://whimsical.com/U25DHtCbQ48sTzc8sEydMB).
I used a header, a section which included a heading, a paragraph and a list and lastly, a footer.

## Building

I used VS Code to code my webite using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### HTML Elements

I used the **header** element to separate the main title and the date from the rest of the website.

Then I used the **section** to indicate that the list with the countries I visited are a seperate part of the webiste.

In the **section** element, I added a **unorderd list** with **images**. Each county is a **hyperlink** to a wikipedia information page.  
Finally the **footer** to display my copyrights.

### CSS

I added colours and borders to HTML elements and resized and style images.
I targeted some elements, a class, and an id in CSS.

### JavaScript

I linked my Hobby.js at the end of my Hobby.html body.
I used the Date() and getElementByID functions to add a date in my website.

Thank you for reading.
